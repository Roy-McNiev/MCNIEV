## Introduction
There is one day when I accidentally realized to do my own calculator project when I was taught to use the Minitab statistical software on the stats class. Since for some tests, we are allowed/required to bring a calculator with us (mine TI). I started to consider about to make things more interesting, defining my calculator and gradually extending its functions.

## Features
* Supports +, -, *, /, ^
* Supports the calculation of sqare root, root, and factorial
* Supports expressions with (nested) parentheses
* Suppports the calculation with negative numbers

## Technologies
This project was created using:
* Java/JDK 15

## Setup
To setup the project, you will have to install JDK 8.0 or a newer version. You will have to run the main method in the Calculaor class.

## Sources
The method used in this project of handling operators is inspired by [@久曲健的测试窝](https://www.cnblogs.com/longronglang/p/13693065.html?ivk_sa=1024320u).
