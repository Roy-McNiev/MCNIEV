An on-building calculator...

## Background
There is one day when I accidentally realized to do my own calculator project when I was taught to use the Minitab statistical software on the stats class. Since for some tests, we are allowed/required to bring a calculator with us (mine TI). I started to consider about to make things more interesting, defining my calculator and gradually extending its functions.
